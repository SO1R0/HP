    <h1 class="title">Authenticity of digital information and its implications for our identity</h1>
    <p class="body-p">This portfolio aims to explore and criticise the state that digital information
         is in right now, as our information literacy to differentiate and validate factual information
          is getting harder. Especially with the rise of large language models in the past year, we are 
          in a very unique position where we are given the choice to reject or accept this new technology.
           In order to conduct this research, I have created and examined 3 projects specifically aimed to
            understand the flaws and implications of such a technological advancement. Furthermore, the
             projects were designed in a way so that the audience can have a balance between immersion, 
             interactivity, and possibly some self-application.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Digital storytelling: Fake news article</h1>
            <p class="body-p">This is an interactive Fake news website I made, which aims to explore 
                information literacy in the contemporary virtual space. The image anchor to the website 
                itself was made with some simple photoshop and the website itself is made to visually
                 replicate a legitimate news website. By using a webpage as a medium of digital storytelling,
                  the audience gets to experience an interactive demonstration of, <br>1. Questioning the
                   legitimacy of the information based on the website aesthetic, <br>2. Identifying any 
                   political affiliations to distinguish whether the information has a narrative behind 
                   it. and  <br>3. Reading the text to check for any fallacious arguments. <br> At the same 
                   time the fact that this website could be published and created by 1 person alone, 
                   also puts into question the legitimacy of sources online, and how careful we need to be
                    in finding the right information. Furthermore, when considering the rise of AI assisted 
                    “newsbots” (https://www.newsguardtech.com/special-reports/newsbots-ai-generated-news-websites-proliferating/)
                     in the recent months, we are conflicted with the notion of reliability as, for now, there 
                     is obscurity regarding the data set used for the training of the model. And even if 
                     language models are able to be adjusted, it also begs the question of how and to what 
                     standard should it be adjusted to. Seeing the impacts of social media and its radicalisation
                     of political sides, the language models political values could ultimately put democracy at 
                     risk, as our identity is often now based on our opinions on politics / values and knowledge, 
                     and the prevalence of this technology in the future makes news sources unreliable to a certain extent. </p>

        <h1 class="title">Data visualisation: Tech and Employment</h1>
        <p class="body-p">The rise of AI and the mass media has built in this fear that people will 
            “get replaced” by AI, particularly in the Job market. As we are in the midst of another 
            technological evolution, we are not yet sure whether this will actually take place. To 
            investigate this matter, I selected a data visualisation in flourish as the medium of choice. 
            To do this, I took employment data from countries which have a data set from 1975 to 2021,
             which in the OECD data base only consisted of Japan and the U.S (https://data.oecd.org/emp/employment-rate.htm).
              I then data mashed general information regarding the technological achievements of years starting 1975,
               from various websites (see info set below) to create a comparative bar graph, alongside an analysis of
                data within the built in story creator. The combination between a quantitative data visualisation alongside
                 a interactive story based analysis allows the audience to infer what the data is trying to convey, in a way
                  where they are able to understand the context behind the data, what it means, allowing them to ultimately 
                  understand the effect in which digital technologies have on our society from a macroeconomic scale.
            <br><br>(I attempted to find a method of changing colours of the bars based on the technological era, however was not able to find any options).

    <h1 class="title">Digital storytelling: Exploration of the “Uncanny Valley”</h1>
    <p class="body-p">Whilst it is easy to measure the quantitative data on the impact of 
        emerging technologies to assess whether they are progressive or disruptive technologies,
         qualitative data is different. For the case of AI LLM (large language models), there is
          a certain sentiment about its intentions of replicating humans from an ability and also
           emotions. In this regard its crucial to assess this notion, and for those reasons, I 
           have chosen to explore the concept of the “Uncanny Valley”, through an online video. 
           This concept can be explained by a basic philosophical question; what 
           identifies / defines a human? The video delves into this notion of human authenticity
            by first, cementing the fact that the content you are watching is mainly by AI. 
            (Despite the original script being completely human made). The second uncanniness 
            is generated through the replication of what a human conversation would sound like,
             where in which the small mistakes in nuances for reading confuses us into thinking 
             that we are hearing something human-like but not exactly human. At the same time 
             the visual images adds another layer on top of this, such that the image matches 
             the contents to a certain extent but sometimes does not, and even more with the fact 
             that the image itself does not look realistic, thereby deepening the valley. 
             Penultimately, the uncanniness could also derive from the contents of discussion, 
             in that it is an AI text read by an AI, about why not to worry about AI, which 
             despite the information provided being accurate, feels almost propaganda like.</p>
